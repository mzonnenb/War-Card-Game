War-Card-Game
=============

Java version of the pseudo-game War for CS110 final project. This repo contains the source code and javaDocs. cardPics folder contains the images for each of the cards, labeled as suit + rank (ace [14] of spades [1] is 114.jpg). 

The IntelliJ IDEA files were mostly removed, would need to be imported again to be useable.
